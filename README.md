# rust-extended

This project is me trying to see if I can figure out how to make jsx but for rust (rsx). It will essentially work like yew's and leptos' html and view macros for writing compiler checked HTML in rust. This is very WIP so drastic and breaking changes are to be expected.

## Goals

- Allow for the use of html-in-rust in a way that is similar to jsx.
- Integrate customized css-in-rust in a [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) kind of way.
- Provide ready-to-use components for common webpage functionalities.
- Possibly allow for a monadic way of writing webpages.

## Directories

There are three main directories:

- `/crates` - Which will contain the library's crates.
- `/examples` - Which will contain examples of how the library could be used to achieve common webpage functionalities.
- `/docs` - Which will contain the documentation for the library.
