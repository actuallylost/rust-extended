# Zeal

An all-in-one batteries included web framework built with ease-of-use in mind, inspired by [Yew](https://yew.rs/) and [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), but with a different approach.

Please note that this project is still in its early stages and everything is subject to change.

## Goals

- Allow for the use of html-in-rust in a way that is similar to jsx, using macros.
- Integrate customized css-in-rust in a [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) kind of way.
- Provide ready-to-use components for common webpage functionalities.
- Possibly allow for a monadic way of writing webpages.

## Directories

There are three main directories:

- `/crates` - Which will contain the library's crates.
- `/examples` - Which will contain examples of how the library could be used to achieve common webpage functionalities.
- `/docs` - Which will contain the documentation for the library.
